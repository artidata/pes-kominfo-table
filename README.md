# pes-kominfo-table

Rebuilding the [pse kominfo table](https://pse.kominfo.go.id/home/pse-asing).

This is an implementation of my other open source project [amplify-cors-proxy](https://github.com/artidata/amplify-cors-proxy).
Instead, of making a fetch request to the data server, we are making the fetch request a proxy server with CORS enabled.
